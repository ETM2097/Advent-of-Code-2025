# Advent of code 2025 |Long Long and the Shorts|

## Introduction
This is the repository of the Advent of Code challenges of 2025, here we are shwowing the implementations that we chose for each day.
There is a folder containing the impementation and technical explanation of each day, where we discuss the details of each implementation

We wanted to make this repository as reusable as possible, so we invested a lot of time in creating general purpose data structures and algorithms that could be used in multiple days, specially in the last days of the challenge.

## Days chosen for presentation
We had a lot of fun developing the code for the challenges, but we decided to present the following days as were the ones that made us really develop our skills and knowledge about data structures and algorithms:

- [AoC1](AoC1) : Where we implemented a rotatory Linked List in order to mimic the physical movement of a dial.

- [AoC5](AoC5) : Where whe implemented a `Tree` class and used it in order to resolve the challenge.

- [AoC7](AoC7) : Where we implemented a `HashMap` and a `Graph` class in order to solve the challenge.

- [AoC11](AoC11) : Where we improved the `HashMap` and `Graph` classes from Day 7 in order to solve more complex graph path counting problems. We would like to highlight that this is the last day we worked on, so we invested more time in making the code as reusable as possible.

- [INCLUDE](INCLUDE) : Where we present the reusable code that we developed for the last days, specially for Day 11. We believe this code can be useful for future and past challenges, so we decided to make it as general as possible. We would like you to take a look at it, even if it is not a direct solution for any specific challenge, it gives a powerful framework for graph management, and HashMap usage. This folder can be also found as a submodule in Day 7 (with it's original README and implementation) and Day 11 (with it's final README and implementation) folders. `Please take a look at it and tell us what do you think about it!`
